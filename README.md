# Asteroids-Game
An Asteroids clone I created in Java using LibGDX. I created this game in order to showcase the screenwrap algorithm that I created previously, allowing for shapes to smoothly transition from one side of the screen to the other (i.e. a shape can be half on the left side of the screen and half on the right side of the screen).  
  
Controls:  
W - Accelerate forwards  
A - Turn Left  
D - Turn Right  
Space - Shoot forwards  
ESC - Exit
