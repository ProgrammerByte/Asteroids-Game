# Asteroids-Game
An Asteroids clone I created in Java using LibGDX. Currently the core gameplay is present however the game isn't fully finished (features I plan on adding include a life system, more types of asteroids, UFOs, and a score system). I created this game in order to showcase my screenwrap algorithm that I created previously, allowing for shapes to smoothly transition from one side of the screen to the other (i.e. a shape can be half on the left side of the screen and half on the right side of the screen).
